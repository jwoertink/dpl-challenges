# Ruby Challenge

## Running
Run the app with `ruby app.rb`

Run the test suite with `ruby test_suite.rb`

## Concept

This command line program asks you to name your character, and give it an age.
The character will talk to you a bit.
The character should say their first name, and should say how old they are,
then gloat about what year they were born.
The character also has a favorite number, and color. Any guess what they are? They should always be random.
Then the character should run and get something.
Each time the character runs to get something, they get a little more tired.
The goal is to wear the character out by running him around. You can test this by viewing the character's energy_level.

## Issues

The app is currently broken. Running it fails with all kinds of errors. Please help!


## Goal

1. Make the program run.
2. Use clean code. Proper syntax, and indentation are a must.
3. Document all methods in the person class
4. Make all tests pass
